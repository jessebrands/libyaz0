                     libyaz0 -- a fast yaz0 implementation

Purpose

	libyaz0 is a small, efficient C library for use in applications that need
	to handle compressed yaz0 data or wish to compress data using the yaz0
	algorithm.

Origin

	The libyaz0 library was started in 2025 because of a few problems with
	other implementations of the yaz0 algorithm.

	First and foremost is speed. Many other implementations of the yaz0
	algorithm are available but few are aggressively optimized while plenty of
	headroom for optimization is available. Furthermore, these libraries lack
	bindings to languages commonly used in the Ocarina of Time Randomizer
	community such as Python 3 and JavaScript.

	libyaz0 aims to solve these problems by providing an implementation of yaz0
	that is both correct and fast by using SIMD instructions when available.
	The library also provides bindings to Python 3 and JavaScript through a
	Python module and a WebAssembly build respectively.

License
	
	libyaz0's code and documentation are covered by the GPL version 3 or (at
	your option) any later version. See the file COPYING for the full text of
	this license.

How to compile and install libyaz0

	Download the latest libyaz0 source tarball, and then:

		tar -xf libyaz0-x.y.tar.gz
		cd libyaz0-x.y
		make

	You will then need to copy libyaz0.so.x.y to a place where your linker can
	find it. The yaz0.h header file should also be copied to your include path 
	under the yaz0 subdirectory.
